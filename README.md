## Challenge statement

The problem the Portfolio Project is intended to solve is the following:

- User engagement: This will be done by offering incentives, such as rewards or cash, for recycling activities. Gamification techniques, such as leaderboards and challenges, can also help increase user engagement
- Waste management logistics: I will integrate features in the app that allow users to schedule pick-ups, track their recycling progress, and receive notifications from collection centers
- Educating users: There will also be a "LEARN" section in the app that provides information on recycling best practices and materials that can be recycled


Who the users will be
- Anyone with Smartphones that has recyclable products
- Working professionals with smartphones
- Companies manufactruing high rectclable products like Coca-cola

Is this project relevant or dependent on a specific locale?

I think this project is really relevant cause, instead of throwing your recyclable products in the bin and having no gain from it, with this, you will not just gain from recycling, but also keep the society clean.
Relevant to people of Nairobi and may later be expanded to other major cities in Kenya

Risks

Technical Risks:
- Toxic waste: People working in the recycling business must be careful with toxic waste such as glass, paper, plastic, iron, and electronic garbage that may generate dust, germs, and contaminated substances causing occupational diseases and accidents
